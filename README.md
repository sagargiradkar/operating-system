# Laboratory Assignments

This GitHub repository contains a collection of laboratory assignments for Group A as part of a course on Information Technology (2019 Course) at Savitribai Phule Pune University. Each assignment focuses on different aspects of IT and operating systems. Below is a list of the assignments along with a brief description of their objectives and requirements.

## Assignment No. 1: Basic Linux Commands and Address Book Implementation

**A. Study of Basic Linux Commands:** This assignment involves studying and demonstrating various Linux commands such as `echo`, `ls`, `read`, `cat`, `touch`, test, loops, arithmetic comparison, conditional loops, `grep`, `sed`, and more.

**B. Address Book Program:** Write a program to implement an address book with options including creating an address book, viewing the address book, inserting a record, deleting a record, modifying a record, and exiting.

## Assignment No. 2: Process Control System Calls

**A. Fork, Execve, and Wait:** Implement a C program that accepts integers to be sorted. The main program uses the `FORK` system call to create a child process. The parent process sorts the integers and waits for the child process using the `WAIT` system call. This assignment also demonstrates zombie and orphan states.

**B. Fork and Execve:** Implement a C program where the main program accepts an array. The main program uses the `FORK` system call to create a child process. The parent process sorts the array and passes the sorted array to the child process through the command line arguments of the `EXECVE` system call. The child process displays the array in reverse order.

## Assignment No. 3: CPU Scheduling Algorithms

Implement the C program for CPU Scheduling Algorithms: Shortest Job First (Preemptive) and Round Robin with different arrival times.

## Assignment No. 4: Thread Synchronization and Mutual Exclusion

**A. Thread Synchronization using Counting Semaphores:** Demonstrate the producer-consumer problem using counting semaphores and mutex.

**B. Thread Synchronization using Mutex:** Demonstrate the Reader-Writer problem with reader priority.

## Assignment No. 5: Deadlock Avoidance Algorithm

Implement the C program for the Banker's Algorithm, a deadlock avoidance algorithm.

## Assignment No. 6: Page Replacement Algorithms

Implement the C program for Page Replacement Algorithms: FCFS, LRU, and Optimal, considering a minimum frame size of three.

## Assignment No. 7: Inter-process Communication in Linux

**A. FIFOS (Named Pipes):** Implement full-duplex communication between two independent processes using FIFOS. The first process accepts sentences, writes them on one pipe, and the second process counts characters, words, and lines in the sentences, writes this output to a text file, and writes the contents of the file on the second pipe to be read by the first process.

**B. Inter-process Communication using Shared Memory:** Implement client and server programs using System V Shared Memory. The server process creates a shared memory segment and writes a message to it. The client process reads the message from the shared memory segment and displays it on the screen.

## Assignment No. 8: Disk Scheduling Algorithms

Implement the C program for Disk Scheduling Algorithms: SSTF, SCAN, C-Look, considering the initial head position moving away from the spindle.
